### 🩺 Project Overview
Swasthya (meaning "Health" in Sanskrit) is a revolutionary decentralized healthcare intelligence network that addresses critical gaps in India's healthcare infrastructure through cutting-edge technology.

### 🎯 Vision
To create a unified, intelligent healthcare ecosystem that empowers patients, optimizes hospital operations, and enables real-time national health intelligence.

### 🔍 Problem Statement
India's healthcare system faces three critical challenges:
* **Fragmented Medical Records:** Patient data is scattered across different hospitals and is often inaccessible when needed most.
* **Delayed Emergency Response:** Inefficient coordination between ambulances, hospitals, and specialists during critical care situations.
* **Manual Hospital Operations:** Suboptimal resource allocation, staff scheduling, and patient flow management lead to inefficiencies.
* **Limited Real-time Insights:** Inadequate public health monitoring prevents proactive responses to disease outbreaks and health trends.

### 🤖 Intelligent Agent Ecosystem

#### 🎯 Demand Forecast Agent
* **Tech Stack:** Meta Kats + PyTorch Forecasting (TFT models)
* **Capabilities:** Time-series analysis for patient admission rates, anomaly detection for potential outbreaks, and seasonal forecasting for resource planning.
* **Advantage:** Better interpretability and performance on complex time-series data compared to traditional LSTMs.

#### 👥 Staff Scheduling Agent (RL)
* **Tech Stack:** Reinforcement Learning + Meta Code Llama
* **Innovation:** The agent not only creates optimal schedules but also uses Code Llama to generate human-readable explanations for its decisions.
* **Benefit:** Enhanced transparency and trust among hospital staff.

#### 🚑 Triage & Acuity Agent
* **Foundation:** NVIDIA CLARA framework
* **Features:** Utilizes pre-trained medical imaging models (e.g., for X-rays, CT scans) for rapid initial assessment.
* **Deployment:** Served via NVIDIA Triton Inference Server for real-time, low-latency inference at the point of care.

#### 🏥 ER/OR Scheduling Agent
* **Hybrid Approach:**
    * **NVIDIA RAPIDS XGBoost:** Predicts surgery duration based on historical data.
    * **GPU-accelerated RL:** Dynamically reschedules operating rooms in real-time as emergencies arise.
* **Performance:** Massively parallel processing on GPUs enables real-time optimization of complex schedules.

#### 📋 Discharge Planning Agent
* **Components:**
    * **NVIDIA CLARA Model Zoo:** Clinical prediction models to identify patients ready for discharge.
    * **Meta Llama 2/3:** Acts as a discharge assistant, analyzing charts, tracking milestones, and generating discharge summaries.
* **Function:** Automates routine discharge tasks to free up clinical staff.

#### 🎮 Supervisor Agent (Central Orchestrator)
* **Brain:** Fine-tuned Meta Llama 2/3 Reasoning Engine
* **Role:** Coordinates the multi-agent system, processes complex queries, and manages negotiations between agents (e.g., balancing ER demand with OR availability).

### 🛠 Technical Implementation

#### Blockchain Layer
A simplified smart contract for managing patient data access.
```solidity
// Health Wallet Smart Contract
contract HealthWallet {
    struct HealthRecord {
        string recordHash;
        uint256 timestamp;
        address provider;
    }

    mapping(address => HealthRecord[]) private patientRecords;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) private authorizedEntities; // patient => provider => isAuthorized

    event AccessGranted(address indexed patient, address indexed provider);
    event AccessRevoked(address indexed patient, address indexed provider);

    // Patients grant access to their records
    function grantAccess(address provider) public {
        authorizedEntities[msg.sender][provider] = true;
        emit AccessGranted(msg.sender, provider);
    }

    // Patients can revoke access
    function revokeAccess(address provider) public {
        authorizedEntities[msg.sender][provider] = false;
        emit AccessRevoked(msg.sender, provider);
    }
}
